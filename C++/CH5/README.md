## Web and Computer Programming &ndash; PM Class
The AM (first-year) class develops websites and learns programming fundamentals, while the PM (second-year) class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 5 &ndash; Functions
### [Practice functions](vsdoubler)
Create a program that will double the numbers that the user will enter. The program will end when the user enters a sentinel value.
### [Functions](vsfunctions)
Write a function titled say_hello() that outputs to the screen "Hello". Modify the function so that it takes an integer argument and says hello a number of times equal to the value passed to it.
### [Store Credit](vsstorecredit)
Click on the link to get the specifications for the problem. Code this project using functions (break the project down into pieces and then write each part as a function).
