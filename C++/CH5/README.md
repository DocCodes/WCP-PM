## Web and Computer Programming - PM Class
The PM class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 5 - Functions
### [Practice functions](vsdoubler)
Create a program that will double the numbers that the user will enter. The program will end when the user enters a sentinel value.
### [Functions](vsfunctions)
Write a function titled say_hello() that outputs to the screen "Hello". Modify the function so that it takes an integer argument and says hello a number of times equal to the value passed to it.
### [Store Credit](vsstorecredit)
