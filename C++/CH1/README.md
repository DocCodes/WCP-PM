## Web and Computer Programming - PM Class
The PM class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 1
### [Tips](Tips)
Chris Johanson wants a program that calculates and displays a 10%, 15% and 20% tip on his total restaurant bill. Display the amounts calculated back to him as well as the total bill with the tip added for each percentage.  
### [Railing Cost](BuildInc)
Builders Inc. wants a program that allows its sales clerks to enter the diameter of a circle and the price of railing material per foot. The program should calculate and display the total price of the railing material.
### [Paychecks](Paycheck)
Sharon receives 24 paychecks each year. She always deposits a specific percentage of her gross pay in her savings account. Sharon wants a program that will calculate and display the total amount she deposited during the year.
### [Swapping](Swapper)
Have the user enter number 1 and then have them enter number 2. Swap the number (ex: if number1 was 45,  and number2 was 18, now swap and number1 should be 18 and number2 should be 45)
