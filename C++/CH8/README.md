## Web and Computer Programming &ndash; PM Class
The AM (first-year) class develops websites and learns programming fundamentals, while the PM (second-year) class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 8 &ndash; Classes
### [Hello World](hello)
Create a class called Hello. In the class create a void method called sayHello. The method will just print "Hello World".
### [Shut the Box](ShutTheBox)
You are to create the game Shut the box. I have included the game instructions below. You need to use random to get the dice rolls.
### [Roman Numerals to Decimal](roman)
Write a program that converts a number entered in Roman numerals to decimal.
### [DayType](daytype)
Design and implement a class dayType that implements the day of the week in a program. The class dayType should store the day, such as Sun for Sunday.
