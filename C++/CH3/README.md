## Web and Computer Programming &ndash; PM Class
The AM (first-year) class develops websites and learns programming fundamentals, while the PM (second-year) class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 3 &ndash; Loops
### [Loops - 20's](Loops20)
Write a program that counts by 20 using the for loop. What needs to be displayed on the screen is the numbers from 20 - 180.
### [Loops - Grades](LoopsGrades)
Professor Krelina needs someone to create an application that will figure his grades. Krelina assigns 4 projects and 2 test. Each project is worth 50 pts and each test is worth 100 pts.
### [Post test loop](PostTest)
Write a program that uses a post test loop (do until or do while). The program needs to ask the user to enter a Celsius temp. and the program will calculate the Fahrenheit that corresponds to that Celsius temp plus print the next 10 Celsius-Fahrenheit temps.
### [Premium Paper](PremiumPaper)
The sales manager at Premium Paper wants a program that allows her to enter the company's income and expense amounts, which will always be integers. The program should calculate and display the company's total income, total expense and profit (or loss).
### [Triangle of asterisks](Triangle)
Allow the user to enter a number in from 4 to 12. If an input error occurs, display an error message and then ask for a number again.
### [Another way to multiple](Multiple)
Calculate the product of 2 numbers WITHOUT using the * operator.
### [Coding test](CodingTest)
People sometimes give their telephone numbers using one or more alphabetic characters. Write a program that accepts a 10-digit telephone number that may contain one or more alphabetic characters.
