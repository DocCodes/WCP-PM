## Web and Computer Programming &ndash; PM Class
The AM (first-year) class develops websites and learns programming fundamentals, while the PM (second-year) class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 6 &ndash; Overloading
### [Piggie Bank](vspiggie)
Suppose you have a Piggie Bank with an initial amount of $50 and you have to add some more amount to it or take money from the Piggie Bank. Allow the user to enter an amount to deposit into the Piggie Bank. Allow the user to enter an amount to be taken from the Piggie Bank.
### [Area](vsarea)
Create 2 area functions: one should only have 1 parameter which will be a double and it will double the amount for the area, the other area function will have 2 inputs (length and width).
### [Sort Them](vssort)
Create 3 arrays with items in each array. One array will be integers and another will be doubles and the last array will be 3 words. Don't use the sort function.
### [Tea Time](teatime)
Tea Time company wants a program that allows a clerk to enter the number of pounds of tea ordered, the price per pound, and whether the customer should be charged a $15 shipping fee.
### [Valley Sort](valleysort)
What? You've never heard of the valley sort? That's because we made it up. At least we think we did - we Googled it and didn't find anything similar. The valley sort goes something like this: 10 8 6 4 2 1 3 5 7 9.
