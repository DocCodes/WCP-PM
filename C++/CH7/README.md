## Web and Computer Programming &ndash; PM Class
The AM (first-year) class develops websites and learns programming fundamentals, while the PM (second-year) class programs in C# during the first semester and C++ during the second semester. Our teacher encourages us to host our code on GitHub and this is my repo for such code.

## C++ Chapter 7 &ndash; Strings
### [String Search](SubstringSearch)
Write a program that takes two arguments at the command line, both strings. The program checks to see whether or not the second string is a substring of the first.
### [Add them Up](addup)
Read in all the records from the given input file and add them up.
### [IP Addresses](ip)
An Internet Protocol address (IP address) is a numerical label assigned to each device (e.g., computer, printer) participating in a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. Your task is to create a program that will classify IP addresses and convert them from 32 bit binary notation to dotted decimal notation.
